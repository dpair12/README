# ReadMe-Generator

## Project Description

This project is a representation of my current knowledge of nodeJs. Using the Challenge 9 ReadMe as a guide, I created this ReadMe Generator application to use the inquirer node module to ask the user a series of questions in the terminal. Upon answering all of these questions, the user inputs are passed into the generateMarkdown.js file where the general format of generated ReadMe files are configured. Once all of the answers are inputted into its designated locations, a message will appear in the terminal stating that the ReadMe file was successfully generated.
